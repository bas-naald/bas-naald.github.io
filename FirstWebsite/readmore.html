<h1>my study choice</h1>
<body>
    <p class="p1"> i was young i started developing interest in computers. i got one for my birthday, and i enyoid playing games a lot. but i quickly started wondering how the things that i was using on my computer were made. so i started looking into programming. and i started a course on the language c++ last summer and followed it to around the halfway point. however i quit this when i had my exams and handball so i had a lot less time for this. (this was when i was when i was not sure to what school i was going to go to yet). then i heard about the HZ. and i found the way the study was devided and that you can specialize later on in your study a fun, and a good idea. besides that i also liked the atmosphere a lot when i was in the school for the first time. </p1>
