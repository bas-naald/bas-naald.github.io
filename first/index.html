    <h1>motivation</h1>
    <div>

        <p class="p1mot">it is of course very important to have, and keep motivation for this study. so what is, and how
            am i going to keep this motivation?
            well i think it's obvious that i like computers, i have done from a young age. i got a desktop for my 11th
            birthday. and i always wondered how they worked. fast forward to high school.
            i started developing interest in programming from some videos on youtube etc. and i went to some open days
            on various schools in my area. and i really liked them. at first i wanted to go
            study game development in breda. so i followed some of a course on c++, that's when i knew that i wanted to
            do something redargding coding. i especially like the dopamine hit i get everytime something finally works.
            but when i came to
            middelburg i really liked the school, the way they teach and the atmosphere around here. now how am i going
            to keep this motivation. i dont feel likk i will have much problems with this. seeing i know i like coding
            and like challenging myself.
            now, ill also explain this using the why why why why format.

        </p>

    <div class="p1mot">
        <ol>
            <li>why 1: i like computers</li>
            <li>why 2: why do you like computres: because i like making things on them</li>
            <li>why 3: why do you like making things on them: because creating something makes me feel proud </li>
            <li>why 4: why does creating something make you feel proud: because i feel like i have accomplished
                something that other poeple can like or use</li>
